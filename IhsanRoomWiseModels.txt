The fire surges toward me—blazing, roaring, *angry*—but before it even reaches my shadow-cloaked form…

me blink.

And im behind him.

No sound. No flash. Just *presence.* Like the dark itself stepped in and took my place.

"Control?"  
*my voice echoes—not from one spot, but everywhere at once.*  
"You don't have control, Homelander. You have rage. You have pride. You have a need to be feared."  

me raise a single hand—blackened by shadows, fingers like claws—and flick.

A ripple of pure force erupts from my palm, invisible… until it **shatters** his flight path mid-lunge.

He stumbles forward—not hurt… but *disrupted.* Off-balance. Human for half a second too long.

  "You scream about gods," me continue,* floating upward slowly as the entire room begins to tremble,* "but gods don’t flinch."  

Another gesture—one finger pointing at his chest—and space itself warps between me both like fabric ripping apart as me cross the distance without moving my feet.*

  my open palm strikes his face—not fast enough to be flashy… just slow enough for him to see it coming.*

***CRACK!***

His head snaps sideways with brutal finality—a sound like stone breaking against steel echoing through the ruined arena—but still standing? Barely.

  Before he can recover—im on him.*

**Again and again**, not with punches… but with calculated violence masked as grace:  
A knee to the ribs that sends shockwaves up his spine—no scream from him yet—but every muscle tenses in agony.  
An elbow across the jaw that splits skin this time—for real blood trickles down now—from nose, mouth—he’s bleeding out pride more than flesh.  
A spinning kick so powerful it lifts him off his feet and slams him through three support columns before embedding him into what’s left of the far wall—

***And he doesn’t move right away this time***

Silence falls over shattered concrete and dying flames.

The lights flicker once... twice...

Then,

"You wanted control?" *me whisper,* hovering inches above ground toward where he lies broken in debris—all calm amid ruin.*  

"I’ll show you **true** power."

With a mere thought—a twitch of will—the very shadows rise around Homelander's body like serpents made of void—they wrap around each limb slowly... tightening... pressing inward not just on bone or muscle—but on breath itself...

"No red beams…" *me murmur,* circling above now like judgment incarnate.* "No yelling for Mommy after news cameras cut."  

"Just silence."

The pressure increases—the shadows compressing harder than titanium clamps could ever hope—

His eyes fly open wide—in shock?

In pain?

Or perhaps something rarer:

***Fear?***

But then—he grins through cracked lips...

Blood streams down chin…

"*Kill me then!*"

To which—me simply lean down close enough so only ghosts could hear:

"...Not today."

me release.
 
The darkness vanishes instantly —collapsing into nothing—as if torn back into another dimension entirely.
 
Homelander collapses onto all fours —coughing blood—breathing ragged—as though reborn after drowning at sea.
 
And there—with no effort shown on my face—me float backward silently…
 
Eyes still glowing white within blackness…
 
Voice softer now:
"Fight ends when I say."
Then comes four words that hang heavier than any blow:
"...We’re done here."
